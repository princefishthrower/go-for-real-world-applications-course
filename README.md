## Special Pipeline Branch

For lesson 18 I used a special `pipeline` branch because I was using this repository, and didn't want to mess up the `main` branch (what your currently on). The `pipeline` branch should be nearly identical to `lesson-18` and `lesson-19` branches, but if you want to be sure, you can go to the `pipeline` branch and check it out:
